# Building Contact Sheet
This Project shows how to make a contact sheet for digital photographers, and how one can take one image and create nine different variants based on the brightness of that image. In this project we are going to change the colors of the image, creating variations based on a single photo. There are many complex ways to change a photograph using variations, such as changing a black and white image to either "cool" variants, which have light purple and blues in them, or "warm" variants, which have touches of yellow and may look sepia toned. In this project, we'll be just changing the image one color channel at a time.

All we have to do is to add an image file to our project and save its path address in file_address variable in the program, and follow the instructions we'll get during run time!

So, in this project we can make to type of contact sheets:

1. Color Variant Contact Sheet
2. Brightness Variant Contact Sheet

## Example: Color Variant Contact Sheet

Input Image :

<img src="https://github.com/saranshkhulbe7/ContactSheetMaker/blob/master/Mountains.jpeg" alt="Input Image" width="30%">

Output Image :

<img src="https://github.com/saranshkhulbe7/ContactSheetMaker/blob/master/Mountains_Color_Variation.jpeg" alt="Output Image" width="75%">

## Example: Brightness Variant Contact Sheet

Input Image :

<img src="https://github.com/saranshkhulbe7/ContactSheetMaker/blob/master/Mountains.jpeg" alt="Input Image" width="30%">

Output Image :
